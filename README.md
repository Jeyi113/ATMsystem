# ATMsystem
The term project of OOP class, which implement the virtual ATM system
Project co-implemented by jeyi Yoo & junseo Kang in 2021

ATM.cpp contains the main function.
The other header files define each classes related with ATM process.
The Class diagram describes the entire code structure through UML diagram.

Just notice, this was my very first term project that I've done cooperating with a teamate.
Also it was my first semester that I started to study C++ languages.
The code lines might not be clean since I was not get used to it.
However, I regard this project as the first step of my journey of computer science.
I learned so mush about C++ language and the necessary skills for writing code during the project.
Thank you for reading.
